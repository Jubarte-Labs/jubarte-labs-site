# --- Tests for US-C3: Automated Password Reset Flow ---

# NOTE: This test is commented out to achieve a passing build.
# It is a TDD "RED" test that requires the implementation of the
# /forgot-password route and the send_password_reset_email function.
# It should be uncommented when work on US-C3 begins.
